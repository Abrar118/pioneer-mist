After the Covid lockdowns had subsided, we were finally able to meet in person for the first time in over a year. 
It was a great experience to see everyone face-to-face and have a real conversation.


# Our First Offline Classes and Sessionals

We had our first offline classes and sessionals, none of us quite knew how to operate nany of the equipments yet and frankly
even after the teacher told us what was what, we couldn't catch them. But as usual, yamin got everything in a jiffy.
