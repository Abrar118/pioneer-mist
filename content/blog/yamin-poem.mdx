# A Brief of My Friendship with Yamin

I first met Yamin when we started our classes of 1-2. Bueven before that, at the time MIST was conducting online
classes due to COVID-19, we were introduced on facebook. We had a natural bond from the beginning and got very close in a while.

# My First Poem for Yamin

I used to write poems for some time. When he got to know that, alongside my other friends, he used to prove read them before
I porsted them. On our second year, for his birthday, I wrote a poem for him. It was simply titled "Yamin". Although we laughted at
it for a while when I showed him that, he loved it.

Yamin

Tales of your days are not told,
Countless adventures into the shipwreck coves.
Stories of your journeys are not read,
The storms, the tides , the gems you held.

But we saw the anchor and the ship.
Felt what it's been through, what lies within.
Up on the mast, in front of the wheel,
Under the deck, you know how it feels.

Once in a cycle land on ground,
Come back home from a trip year around.
Treasures salvaged from ocean's deep,
Will make your return worth indeed.

Happy a day, distressed the rest,
I'll be there to make amends.
Tales of your days will be told,
Craziness, madness on the south sea shores.
```

# My Second Poem for Yamin

I gave him a poem for his birthday last year. Yamin said, "Eto choto poem keno". I replied, 
"Accha next year boro ekta likhe dibo insha allah". A poem which started out as a gift for a friend for his birthday, 
turned out to be a mourning letter. 
This is for my friend _**Shykh Aashhabul Yamin**_ who stayed true to his beliefs till the end.

In Memory of A Young Soul

In the silence of the night,
where stars whisper soft and low,
We remember you,
more deeply than you'll ever know.

You were a guiding light,
in a world so dark and vast,
And though I'm still wandering,
your memory holds me fast.

I know they say to be patient,
that time will heal the pain,
But inside, I'm still lost,
waiting for the sun after the rain.

Tell me it's okay, that I'm breaking down once more,
Tell me it's okay, that I'm crumbling to the core.
That though I'm lost inside my head, your light will guide me yet,
That you'll never be someone I could ever forget.

I've been dreaming of the songs we'd sing,
on a stage so bright and high,
Wondering if I'll ever live that dream,
or just let it pass by.

Tell me it's okay, that I'm breaking down again,
Tell me it's okay, that I don't have to pretend.
That though I'm lost inside my head, your memory's here to stay,
That you'll never be someone easy to fade away.

Trying to remember why
These hard days come and go,
It's just too hard to breathe,
too hard to let you go.

I’d give you the sky but I’m scared that I'm too late
But I was not ready for you to die in our embrace.
But I hope you don’t mind if I’m a little behind
It’s just so easy to get so lost

Tell me it's okay, that I'm breaking down once more,
Tell me it's okay, that this pain I can endure.
That though you're gone, your spirit lingers on,
A friend, a guide, in my heart, forever strong.

I'd go to hell and back to save you,
to have you by my side,
Spend forever staying up too late,
with love we couldn't hide.

The way you laughed,
the way you read my mind,
We broke all the rules,
crossed every line.

And I swear to God,
I'll try my best to get it right this time,
To keep your memory close,
in every verse and rhyme.

So tell me it's okay, that I'm breaking down again,
Tell me it's okay, that my heart will one day mend.
That though you're lost to time, your spirit's here with me,
A friend, a love, a beacon, for all eternity.

## To Conclude
Even if yamin is not with us anymore, his memories will always be with us. I will always remember him as a brave friend who stood up for his beliefs till the end.
