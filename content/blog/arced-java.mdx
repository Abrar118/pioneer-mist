In his 2nd year, Shykh Ashhabul Yamin had a unique opportunity to participate in a JAVA research study organised by the ARCED Foundation at Mirpur DOHS. This initiative, backed by researchers from the University of California San Diego and the University of Colorado Denver, aimed to explore the working habits of computer programmers. The foundation sought undergraduate students with a computer science background to contribute to this exciting research.

The study was limited to the first 500 applicants and required about four hours of participants' time, during which they tackled programming tasks in JAVA. The incentives included an honorarium of 1100 BDT and a certificate of participation.

Yamin took on this challenge and successfully solved a good number of problems, earning his honorarium. This picture captures Yamin celebrating with his friends in the Hall.
