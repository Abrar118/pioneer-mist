In his 3rd year, Shykh Ashhabul Yamin had the opportunity to participate in an industrial attachment at the Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited (DESCO). This initiative aimed to provide students with practical experience in the field of electrical engineering. The attachment was limited to the first 50 applicants and required about 30 days of participants' time, during which they worked on various projects related to power distribution and management.
